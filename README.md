### Upcoming Features:

- **Database Migrations**: We plan to implement a powerful migration system to easily manage database schema changes. This feature will allow developers to version control their database structure and apply updates consistently across different environments.
  
- **Queue Processing**: Another future enhancement will be the addition of a queue system. This will allow developers to handle background tasks, such as email sending, notifications, or any asynchronous operations, ensuring efficient processing without blocking the main application flow.

These features are in the early stages of planning and development. You can follow the progress or contribute to these efforts by checking our [open issues](#) or [milestones](#) on GitHub.
